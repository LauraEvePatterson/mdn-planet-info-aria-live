# ARIA Live Regions Example

This repository contains a basic example demonstrating the use of ARIA live regions to enhance accessibility on the web. The example is based on the MDN Web Docs example titled "Dropdown box updates useful onscreen information," which showcases dynamic updates of planet information when a user selects a planet from a dropdown menu.

## Example Description

The example consists of an HTML file (`index.html`) and a JavaScript file (`script.js`). The HTML file contains the structure for the dropdown menu, live region, and associated elements, while the JavaScript file contains code responsible for updating the live region with information about the selected planet.

## Example Structure

The example includes the following components:

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure for the dropdown menu, live region, and associated elements.
- `script.js`: Contains JavaScript code responsible for updating the live region with information about the selected planet.

## Usage

To use this example, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/aria-live-example.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

3. Interact with the dropdown menu by selecting different planets to observe how the live region updates with relevant information about the selected planet.

## Accessibility Considerations

The example demonstrates best practices in web accessibility by utilizing ARIA live regions to provide dynamic updates to users of assistive technologies, such as screen readers. The live region is configured with `aria-live="polite"`, ensuring that screen readers will announce updates to users in a non-intrusive manner.
